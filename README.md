This repository contains a collection of projects related to Data Science and Machine Learning, including classification, regression, and real-world data processing tasks.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `classification_model/`: Contains classification models using algorithms like KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.
- `regression_model/`: Includes linear and non-linear regression models.
- `job_classification/`: A project for job classification using real-world data.
- `datasets/`: Datasets used across various projects.

## 🛠️ Installation Guide

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tuyenmon2201/Data-Science-ML.git
cd Data-Science-ML
```

### 2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install required libraries

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> 💡 **Note**: If `requirements.txt` is missing, manually install commonly used libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, etc.

## 🚀 How to Run
